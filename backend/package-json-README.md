## Purpose
This file exists because NPM does not allow comments inside package*.json.

Why JSON Doesn't Support Comments:
1. JSON Specification:
    - JSON is designed to be a data interchange format
    - It's meant to be machine-readable, not human-readable
    - Comments would make it non-standard JSON
    - Many parsers and tools expect strict JSON

2. What Happens:
    ❌ npm expects valid JSON
    ❌ Docker expects valid JSON
    ❌ CI/CD tools expect valid JSON
    ❌ Most JSON parsers will fail with comments

/**
 * 📦 What is package.json?
 * 
 * - This file defines your Node.js project's metadata, dependencies, scripts, and more.
 * - It tells npm (Node Package Manager) what packages your project needs to run, build, or test.
 * - It also includes project info like name, version, author, and license.
 * 
 * Example sections in package.json:
 *   - "dependencies": Packages required for your app to run.
 *   - "devDependencies": Packages needed only for development (like testing tools).
 *   - "scripts": Shortcuts to run commands (e.g., "npm start", "npm run build").
 * 
 * 📑 What is package-lock.json?
 * 
 * - This file is automatically generated by npm when you install or update dependencies.
 * - It locks the exact versions of every installed package (and their dependencies).
 * - This ensures that everyone working on the project (or deploying it) gets the same dependency versions, avoiding "works on my machine" issues.
 * - You should commit this file to version control (git).
 * 
 * 🛠️ When do you update these files?
 * 
 * - package.json changes when you:
 *     - Add, remove, or update dependencies (using npm install, uninstall, or update).
 *     - Change scripts or project metadata.
 * - package-lock.json updates automatically whenever you run npm install or change dependencies.
 * 
 * 🔄 How to update package-lock.json?
 * 
 * - If you add or remove a dependency:
 *     npm install <package-name>
 *     npm uninstall <package-name>
 * 
 * - To refresh all dependencies and update the lock file:
 *     npm install
 * 
 * - To update all packages to their latest allowed versions (according to package.json):
 *     npm update
 * 
 * - If your lock file gets out of sync or corrupted, you can regenerate it:
 *     rm package-lock.json node_modules/ -rf
 *     npm install
 * 
 * 💡 TL;DR:
 * - Edit package.json to change dependencies or scripts.
 * - Run npm install to update package-lock.json.
 * - Always commit both files to git!
